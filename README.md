# Description of the update of the lenstronomy

This repository contains modifications of lenstronomy based on the late August 2021 version of the original lenstronomy https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy .

The purpose of this modification is to analyze the noise of the ALMA data by studying the non-diagonal pixel-pixel covariance matrix of the noise
and thus help to fit the lens and source model of a gravitational lens picture.

Here is the list of the updates based on the original lenstronomy: (place holder)
